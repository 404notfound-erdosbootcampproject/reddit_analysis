Predicting the eventual popularity of posts on forums for amateur investors is becoming increasingly important. When making such a prediction, one might expectthat a myriad of qualities for a given post are essential. However, our analysis of thedata has revealed that the number of comments in a given time interval is much more important than other qualities. Moreover, we have also discovered that the overall popularity of a forum in a given time may cause unpopular posts to appear popular and vice versa. To obtain an unbiased prediction, this must be taken into account.

Our goal is to get more accurate popularity predictions within limited initial time period after a post goes on live. The accuracy may get better if we run the classifier over time with more data.
