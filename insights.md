Predicting the eventual popularity of posts on forums for amateur investors is becoming increasingly important. In particular, it is valuble to predict whether a post will cross a certain threshold of popularity, since this determines its visibility.

Our model has the simple goal of using data gathered during the first two hours of a post which made the top posts of the week on r/wallstreetbets and using that data to predict whether the post reached the top 50% of most popular posts.

We should expect should this task to be difficult, for if it were easy Reddit would long ago have been gamed. We found the most variables that one would intuitively expect to be related to the post's popularity, such as title length, body length, and sentiment (as determined by VADER), had no relationship to the popularity. The only variable that was a useful predictor was the number of comments, gathered at various times in the post's life. We found that gathering this data at 30 and 60 minutes resulted in a declision tree classifier which was meaningfully better than random guessing. Of course the prediction can be improved by also considering the number of comments at 90 and 120 minutes, but beyond a certain point the number of comments becomes a trivial predictor of the posts's popularity.
