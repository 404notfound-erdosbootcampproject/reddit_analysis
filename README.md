## Project Overview
Online financial forums have started to have non-trivial impacts on market activity. Recent examples include:
- Elon Musk's tweets about cryptocurrencies and their influence on cryptocurrency prices
- and the GameStop short squeeze, which was driven by posts on the subreddit WallStreetBets. 

For a subreddit, it is therefore useful to have predictors for the "popularity" of a post. Our project defines a "popularity" metric and models this using features of a post that can be gathered within an hour of its posting.

## Description of the Data

We used the Python Reddit API Wrapper, known as "PRAW," to scrape data on the posts and on the comments from the subreddit WallStreetBets. The data for each comment includes the id of the parent post, which allows us to link the comment data to the post data.

Our preliminary analysis showed that the data for meme posts and non-meme posts is shaped very different, so for this project, we decided to restrict ourselves to analyzing non-meme posts.
